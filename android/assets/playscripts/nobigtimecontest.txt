ROSEANNE: Hey, look what I brought ya!
DAN: Oh thanks baby, just... put it down here...
DAN: This drill hasn't worked since... Since I bought it.
ROSEANNE: I thought you was out here composing.
DAN: Oh I tried a few things but, uh... I dunno I guess I just wasn't inspired.
ROSEANNE: Well I'm here now.
DAN: And yet somehow I'm still not inspired?
ROSEANNE: Well if you're not gonna write no songs why don't you dig out some of these to send in?
DAN: I already looked, believe me there's nothing in there worth sending.
ROSEANNE: Oh don't give me that there's bound to be an undiscovered masterpiece in here.
DAN: Trust me, they all suck mud. Face it I'm a small time contractor, I ain't no big time composer.
ROSEANNE: Well this is no big time contest! What is this?
DAN: What?
ROSEANNE: <sings> "Ooh baby baby / give it to me / give it to me / Hey baby baby / give it to me / give it to me"
DAN: Give it to me.
DAN: It was a... It was a dance hit.
ROSEANNE: Oh in the 70s I guess...
DAN: Yeah it's just, lyrics weren't important.
ROSEANNE: I was really moved by it, I was getting ready to give it to ya.
DAN: Oh! Ha! You wanna hear something really bad?
ROSEANNE:  Is it worse than that one?
DAN: Much worse. Almost criminal.
ROSEANNE: Ooh baby baby give it to me.
DAN: I wrote this when I was 19. Let's see...
DAN: "Blueberry fantasy / tangerine dream"
DAN: <sings> "Love is a rainbow / of incense and cream"
ROSEANNE: Oh now I know why you can't remember your teen years.
DAN: It marked the end of my psychedelic period.
ROSEANNE: No that's the one, you wanna send that in!
DAN: Ah, let's just forget about the contest and clean up this mess.
ROSEANNE: All right you're the boss.
DAN: ...
DAN: I'm sorry for a minute there I thought I heard you say I was the boss.
ROSEANNE: <laughs>
ROSEANNE: What's that?
DAN: Oh that's nothing it's just... something I was workin' on.
ROSEANNE: Hey let me hear it!
DAN: Well it doesn't really have a tune yet.
ROSEANNE: So I wanna hear it anyway.
DAN: Well I'm kinda rusty. Let's see.
DAN: <hesitantly sings> "There's a river..."
DAN: <sings> "There's a river high in the mountains / that's been flowing since who knows when"
ROSEANNE: I like it!
DAN: You don't recognise it, do you?
ROSEANNE: Uh-uh.
DAN: No? <sings> "No one's sure just how it started / but it's never gonnna end". It's one of you poems.
ROSEANNE: ...
ROSEANNE: Gosh that is. I can't believe you saved it.
DAN: Yeah I've saved everything you've ever written.
DAN: Except for a few notes on the refrigerator door.
ROSEANNE: That's so *sweet*.
DAN: You like it?
ROSEANNE: Yeah!
DAN: Well it's half yours. Maybe if I goose it up a little bit.
DAN: <sings better> "There's a river high in the mountains / that's been flowing since who knows when / no one's sure just how it started / but it's never gonnna end"
DAN: <sings louder> "Our love is like that river / flowing through all time / heaven knows I need you / and I'll never change my mind"
DAN: <still singing> "Heaven knows how I love you and I'll ne-ver change my mind"
DAN: Yeah? You like it?
ROSEANNE: It's beautiful!
DAN: Yeah? You think it's good enough to enter?
ROSEANNE: I think it's good enough to win?
DAN: Yeah?  
ROSEANNE: Yeah I really do.
DAN: Really?
ROSEANNE: I really really do! 
ROSEANNE: Hey and you know then when we go out on tour the kids ain't coming with us, right?
DAN: Right!
